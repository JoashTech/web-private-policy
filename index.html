    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is rated E for Everyone and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on Android's built-in security features, such as app sandboxing, to protect local data stored on your device. Since no data is transmitted to our servers, there is no risk of server-side data breaches. Our third-party partners implement their own security measures as described in their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>8. International Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union (GDPR) or California (CCPA), you may have additional rights, such as requesting data access or deletion. Since we only store data locally and use third-party services for ads and analytics, you can exercise these rights through your device settings or our partners' privacy controls. Contact us for assistance with data subject requests.</p>
